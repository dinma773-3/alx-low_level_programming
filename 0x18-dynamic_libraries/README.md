# 0x18. C - Dynamic libraries
    # Objectives: To know;
    What is a dynamic library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
    What is the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and how to use it
    What are the differences between static and shared libraries
    Basic usage nm, ldd, ldconfig


    # What is expected;
       # Task 0;
       Create the dynamic library libdynamic.so containing all the functions
       If you haven’t coded all of the above functions create empty ones, with the right prototype.
       Don’t forget to push your main.h file in your repository, containing at least all the prototypes of the above functions.
       # Task 1;
       Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
       #Task 2;
       Create a dynamic library that contains C functions that can be called from Python. See example for more detail
       # Task 3;
       run two commands on the same server where the Giga Millions program runs, could you make me win the Jackpot
